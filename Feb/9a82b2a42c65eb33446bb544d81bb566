The DA welcomes the announcement that children will be allowed to go back to school full time. However, we will only withdraw our court action once the new regulations have been officially promulgated. We note that this announcement comes six months late for primary schools, as the government’s own medical advisory council (MAC) advised in July last year already that it is safe for primary school children to attend school on a full-time basis. Poor schoolchildren have lost 50-70% of their learning time, much of this unnecessarily. The regulations necessitating rotational schooling in poor schools have severely impacted curriculum coverage, learner drop-outs, learner pregnancies, learning outcomes, and the wellbeing of both poor school children and their parents. About 90% of all school children have been affected. The DA’s recommendations to the Department of Basic Education: The DA will conduct oversights to ensure that promises made by the department such as providing for mobile classrooms in the provinces are adhered to. We will continue to monitor curriculum coverage plans to ensure schools catch up on the 50-70% learning time lost as highlighted by the NIDS-CRAMS study. Finally, we call on government to end the state of disaster. The pandemic has become endemic and requires a more normalised response. The real disasters now are unemployment and major learning losses. These should be the focus.
