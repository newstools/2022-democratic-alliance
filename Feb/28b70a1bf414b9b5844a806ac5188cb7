Please find attached English and Afrikaans soundbites by Chantel King MP. The DA has submitted Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) applications to South Africa’s 13 medical schools to ascertain their admissions requirements specifically regarding race. This follows the resignation of Dr Angelique Coetzee as chairperson of the South African Medical Association (SAMA) after her comments in the media that “admissions to medical schools were highly politicised, that race played a significant role in determining acceptance to medical faculties, in many instances more than the applicant’s matric performance, and that different criteria exist for different race groups with regard to admission requirements”. The University of Cape Town (UCT) 2022 prospectus also recently came under the spotlight regarding the extensive race-based criteria built into its admissions process. The DA’s PAIA applications will ascertain: We have submitted the PAIA applications to the following universities: With the desperate shortage of medical professionals in South Africa, we believe that all deserving students should be admitted to study medicine, and that no student should be left behind based on the colour of their skin. The country’s healthcare systems are under severe pressure, and barring worthy candidates from entering the medical profession is not only a disservice to those individuals, but also disadvantages the public, including the poor and vulnerable.
