Please find attached English and Afrikaans soundbites by Kevin Mileham MP. The DA welcomes the announcement by City of Cape Town Mayor, Geordin Hill-Lewis, that the first round for a tender procurement process for independent power producers (IPP) to provide up to 300MW of renewable energy has been opened. The City of Cape Town and its residents are now well on their way to becoming energy independent. We are pleased to see the progress Mayor Hill-Lewis has made in achieving his election promises of freeing Cape Town residents and businesses from Eskom’s rolling blackouts. It has been estimated that rolling blackouts cost the South African economy R500 million per stage, per day. No growing, sustainable economy can thrive with an unsustainable electricity supply. We commend Mayor Hill-Lewis and his team for continuing to set an example of what a progressive, delivery-centric government looks like.
