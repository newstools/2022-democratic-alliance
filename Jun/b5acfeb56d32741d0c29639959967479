The DA adds its voice to the chorus of calls for open air sporting events to be allowed to be fully capacitated. Recently, the Premier of the Western Cape, Alan Winde, and the Mayor of Cape Town, Geordin Hill-Lewis, have both appealed to the President to lift the remaining event capacity limitations in stadiums. Sport events is a critical component of our economy and a key driver in job creation, but this sector continues to suffer severely due to restrictions. Currently a maximum of 50% of the crowd is allowed to be in stadiums during matches. The DA urges Nathi Mthethwa, Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, to reopen sporting and cultural events to full capacity. Other industries have returned to some semblance of normalcy, but the sports industry is hampered by stringent and unreasonable restrictions. These restrictions are non-sensical as masks are no longer compulsory outside and most sporting events – especially those in stadiums – take place outside. The illogical restrictions have in fact become a mockery as was seen last night in the match between the Stormers and the Blue Bulls. Limiting the capacity in the stadium only meant that all the supporters moved down the half empty pavilion to the bottom of the stadium with no social distancing, leaving the upper parts of the stadium empty. The lifting of the cap on the number of supporters allowed in stadiums will aid in the recovery of a sports industry that has been destroyed by years of restrictions, especially with major events coming up in the next month, such as the Durban July. These events have the ability to create jobs and give the tourism industry a much-needed boost. We have long advocated for striking a balance in response to Covid-19, ensuring that while saving lives is our top priority, we also do everything we can to protect livelihoods.
