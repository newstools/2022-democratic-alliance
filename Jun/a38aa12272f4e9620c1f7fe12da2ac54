Please find attached soundbites in English and Afrikaans by Cilliers Brink MP, DA Shadow Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the progress that has been made by the Tshwane coalition government in investigating the Rooiwal matter. Earlier this year Mayor Randall Williams ordered a forensic investigation into the first phase of project to refurbish this waste water treatment plant. Mayor Williams’ decision was a response to findings by the Auditor-General into the appointment of the contractor on the project. The investigation is now underway, and Mayor Williams will today ask the municipal council to give forensic investigates six weeks to complete their work. It is essential that this investigation be completed, and that no further time is wasted in ensuring that the long-standing problems at Rooiwal be resolved. If any improprieties were committed in the awarding of the Rooiwal contract, this investigation is what will unearth the necessary evidence. We welcome the example of openness and accountability set by Tshwane and Mayor Williams.
