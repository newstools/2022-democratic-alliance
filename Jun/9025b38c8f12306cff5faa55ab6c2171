Please find attached: Exactly a week ago, the final part of the Zondo State Capture Commission Report was handed over to the President and made public. Since then, South Africans, frustrated by Stage 6 loadshedding and the breakdown and corruption of state institutions, want to know: What now? The answer is that the DA will fight to make these findings count for something. We therefore today laid criminal charges, requesting that the ANC, that has acted like a criminal syndicate, be investigated for systemic and calculated racketeering activities over a multitude of years. In March 2019, the DA wrote to the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi, requesting that the ANC be investigated for systemic and calculated fraud, racketeering, corruption, looting of public money and related offences over the past two decades. More than three years later, the NPA has taken no visible action to investigate the ANC for these crimes. But now, we have the evidence procured by the Zondo Commission, justifying such an invetigation and such a charge. For the Zondo Commission to have any credibility in the eys of ordinary South Africans, criminal chages, arrests and prosecutions must now follow.
