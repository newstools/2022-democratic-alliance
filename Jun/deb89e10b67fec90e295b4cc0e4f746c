Find attached a voicenote from the DA Shadow Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Tsepo Mhlongo MP The Democratic Alliance (DA) will write to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts, and Culture to request an urgent meeting with the leadership of the SAFA to update Parliament on its readiness for the upcoming June 26 leadership elections where the Federation will elect a new President and NEC members. The leadership race has already been marred by controversy which includes the disqualification of other candidates. The DA is calling for free, fair and independent SAFA elections. Disputes should be handled efficiently and transparently in accordance with the prescripts of the National Sport and Recreation Act 18 of 2007 which offers clear guidance on how disputes should be addressed and ultimately resolved. SAFA leadership over the past number of years can only be described as chaotic and dysfunctional. For years, SAFA has been hamstrung by internal squabbles and political meddling which have restricted its ability to deliver the country’s best soccer teams at international sports events. The DA, therefore, urges all those who will vote in these elections to adhere to the SAFA constitution and keep the interests of South Africa’s sports development and soccer management in mind when they cast their votes.
