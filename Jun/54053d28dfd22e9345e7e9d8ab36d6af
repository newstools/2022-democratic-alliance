Year after year the ANC government has proven that commemoration occasions are not coupled with action. This week, government commemorated Child Protection Week. Despite perpetual promises from government to end crimes against children, they face increasing danger in South Africa. The ANC government is failing the children of South Africa. Children need to be protected at all costs. As much as Child Protection Week can be commended, we must do all in our power to protect children throughout the year. It is clear that the ANC is failing in protecting the children of South Africa as we continue to see the numbers of these statistics grow year on year. The ANC government cannot be allowed to continue making empty promises. They must action their various plans and ensure the safety of all children.
