Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by Dave Bryant MP. The DA calls on the Ministers of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries and Transport to urgently make provision for small scale fishers who stand to be devastated by the increasing cost of petrol. There is growing concern regarding the impact of the rising cost of petrol on small scale fisher folk. Larger fishing companies make use of diesel for their boats and if they are VAT registered they are eligible for a diesel rebate. Smaller boat owners who make use of petrol have no such cover and stand to be severely impacted by the massive petrol price increases. Last month the DA asked the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, to assist fisher folk with the rising cost of fuel. We received a one-line response simply saying that the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) has no influence over the fuel price. This shows the complete lack of concern for small scale fishing concerns by the ANC government. Ministers should be committing to raise these concerns with their cabinet colleagues as a matter of urgency. South Africa’s small scale and traditional fishing communities are already reeling from the bungling of the Western Cape small scale fishing process and the Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP).
