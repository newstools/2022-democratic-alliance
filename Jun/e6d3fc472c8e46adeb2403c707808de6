Please find attached and English and Afrikaans soundbite by Cilliers Brink MP. The residents of Ward 4 in Kareeberg in the Northern Cape have placed their faith and trust in the DA. In a stunning increase from 13.35% in 2001 to 42.77% in today’s by-election, the residents of ward 4 have voted the ANC out and sent a strong message that the time for empty promises is over. With a convincing 72% turnout, the smaller parties virtually faded away while the ANC remained stagnant. Voters clearly united behind the DA and chose not to split the vote. This is a very encouraging trend in the run-up to Election 2024, where the ANC can and must be voted out of government in the Northern Cape.
