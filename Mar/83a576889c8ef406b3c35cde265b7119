Please find an attached soundbite by Michele Clarke MP. The DA’s oversight inspection to the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg on Monday revealed a host of concerns that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Serious problems at this hospital not only limit the quality of care possible for patients, but also have a severe impact on the mental health of health practitioners. Amongst the many problems hindering the hospital are: While Baragwanath has entered into public-private partnerships to improve health care at the hospital, it is still extremely worrying that the Gauteng Department of Health is continuously dropping the ball here. R4.59 million is still owed to service providers, and should they not be paid in time it could lead to another shortage of food and other supplies vital to patient care. If the ANC government cannot even look after a single hospital in one province, how will it manage a system as complex as the National Health Insurance (NHI). While the DA believes in universal health care, the NHI is not the vehicle to drive this, and certainly not by the inept ANC government. If the mismanagement of the Baragwanath and Charlotte Maxeke hospitals and the Anglo Ashanti Hospital in the Far West Rand have shown us anything, it’s that the ANC government is completely incapable of sustainable patient care and management of health care systems. Under the ruling party’s watch, national health care in South Africa has been destroyed.
