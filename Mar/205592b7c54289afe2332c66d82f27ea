Please find an attached soundbite by Mat Cuthbert MP The DA has recently learnt of the appointment of four new National Lotteries Commission (NLC) board members upon the expiry of the previous members’ terms of office. While we welcome the non-renewal of previous board members’ terms, on account of their total inability to deal with industrial scale looting of public funds, we encourage the newly appoint board members to do what is right. Their primary task is to clean up the rot at the organisation and cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those who are guilty of corruption are brought to book. We are also particularly concerned by media reports related to a company chaired by newly appointed board member Dr. Cassius Lubisi. (See here) It is alleged by the Mail & Guardian that the company Morar Incorporated: We call on Dr. Lubisi to clarify these allegations levelled against his employer before taking up his seat on the NLC board. South Africans are tired of the ongoing corruption at the NLC and want the organisation to revert back to its intended purpose, which is to provide funds for non-profit organisations to uplift the most vulnerable in society. The DA will ensure that the new board is held to account for its performance – failure to discharge their duties will result in severe consequences for them. If President Ramaphosa won’t fire any of his crooks and freeloaders in Cabinet, we will take that burden off his hands and do it for him.
