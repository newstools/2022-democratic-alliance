The DA notes the developments with regard to the impeachment process of the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, and the intention of suspension indicated by the President, pending the reasons for not doing so to be provided by the Public Protector. This process is both necessary and urgent given the numerous negative judgements expressed against the Public Protector. We hope that this process reaches a conclusion in the near future.
