Ayanda Dlodlo has been a disaster for the South African public service. As Minister of Public Service and Administration, she has overseen the implosion of service delivery through her refusal to confront the ANC policy of cadre deployment. And instead of reducing the public sector wage bill to help South Africa avoid a debt crisis, she granted illegally a R30.2 billion salary increase to keep the wheels of ANC patronage turning. Ayanda Dlodlo has chosen ANC cadres over the people of South Africa. She must go! If President Ramaphosa won’t fire any of his crooks and freeloaders in Cabinet, we will take that burden off his hands and do it for him.
