Please find an attached soundbite by Zakhele Mbhele MP The DA’s Motion of No Confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet comes because they have collectively failed to carry out their responsibilities. One such individual is Deputy President David Mabuza. We would be remiss if we did not include him among those who have betrayed the trust of the South African people. Mabuza has done nothing for this country during his term as Deputy President. It is almost as if the title “Deputy President” was bestowed on him solely to appease the RET faction in the ANC, with no real responsibilities attached, but at a significant cost to taxpayers. Here are five good reasons the DA believes David Mabuza must be fired: It is quite evident that David Mabuza has been a hurdle to South Africa’s growth path as a leader of government enterprise. According to section 92 (2) of the constitution, members of the Cabinet are accountable collectively and individually to Parliament for the exercise of their powers and the performance of their functions. Parliament is therefore duty-bound to hold Mabuza and company accountable – he must go.
