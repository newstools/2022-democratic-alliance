Please find an attached soundbite by Dr Michael Cardo MP On Wednesday, Parliament will debate the DA’s Motion of No Confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet of incompetents. Although there is extremely stiff competition for the position of worst-performing Minister, the DA believes that the Minister of Employment and Labour, Thulas Nxesi, deserves to figure at the front of the pack. Below are five reasons why Nxesi should be axed. For as long as Minister Nxesi remains in his cabinet position, unemployment will continue to rocket, and the government will stay wedded to all the wrong solutions. The time has come for him to get the chop. If President Ramaphosa won’t fire any of his crooks and freeloaders in Cabinet, we will take that burden off his hands and do it for him.
