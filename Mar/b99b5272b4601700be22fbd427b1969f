Please find an attached soundbite by Tsepo Mhlongo MP Following reports that the Liliesleaf Farm is set to receive a bailout of R7 million  from the National Treasury, the DA calls on Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa to inform us what he has done to secure the survival of other heritage sites and museums. Last year the DA called on Minister Mthethwa to appear before the Committee to inform Parliament on his plans to revitalise not only Liliesleaf, but all of South Africa’s historical museums that are facing the same fate. The DA pointed out that the District Six Museum, Apartheid Museum, and some of late President Nelson Mandela’s homes are also struggling to stay open due to financial difficulties and should be given the required attention by the Minister. While Liliesleaf’s bailout can be seen a step in the right direction, it is only one of many museums that have incurred financial difficulties and cannot be singled out for financing. Furthermore, Liliesleaf is receiving this bailout despite the fact that its board members misappropriated R8 million, for which no one has been held accountable. This demonstrates that the blame for Lilies farm’s problems can be laid at the feet of its board members, because most of the problems could have been averted and millions of rands in taxpayer’s money saved if a competent and honest board had been in place. Liliesleaf board members are in line to join a lengthy list of elitists who operate government-sponsored businesses that mismanage funds with impunity. The DA will not let this go unchallenged; all those responsible for the museums’ near-collapse must be held accountable, removed from their positions, and if crimes were committed, they must be charged and convicted, and this must be done before any new bailouts are sanctioned.
