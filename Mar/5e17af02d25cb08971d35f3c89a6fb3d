Please find an attached soundbite by Dean Macpherson MP. Within the next few weeks, the DA will publish its ‘Notice of Intention to Introduce a Private Members Bill and Invitation for Comment’ in the Government Gazette. The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Amendment Act, or ‘Social Impact Bill’ will amend the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA), scrap the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act, and ultimately enact what PPPFA failed to do with BBBEE – address the root causes of inequality of opportunity across South African society. The Social Impact Bill will amend sections 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), as well as section (2)(1)(d)(i) of the PPPFA and introduce criteria based on sustainable development goals (SDGs). This will better serve social and economic development for the most vulnerable communities in the country. For many years, the rich and politically connected have abused the PPPFA to enrich themselves. This was enabled by an ANC government that only focused on cadres and comrades, and paid little mind to founding principles of the Act which was to root out inequality and create a better future for all South Africans. Our Bill’s SDG model has a number of benefits over the current BBBEE model: The DA encourages the public and all interested parties to submit their comments on our proposed Social Impact Bill once our Notice of Intention has been gazetted. These comments will be evaluated and the Bill will then be submitted to Parliament. The current legislation needs a serious and urgent overhaul if South Africa is to weather its current economic decimation. True equality can only be achieved when individuals have a wealth of opportunity to better their lives.
