Please find an attached soundbite by Michele Clarke MP The DA will write a letter to the Member of the Mayoral Committee in Ekurhuleni, Heather Heart, in order to request,  for the City Planning Department to conduct a compliance inspection to check whether OR Tambo hospital is in compliance with the Cities building regulations and by-laws.  Five years ago, the province embarked on a project to replace the hospital but the project never got off the ground due to financial constraints. The plans were passed, however till date, the project never came to fruition due to funding constraints. Last week, the DA Shadow Minister of Health, Michele Clarke, and the DA Deputy Shadow Minister of Health, Haseena Ismail conducted an oversight visit to OR Tambo Hospital in Gauteng. These are the main challenges the hospital is facing: Healthcare is one of the most important services in the country. In order to provide quality healthcare services to communities and to ensure public health workers’ moral remain high, there is a need to ensure that health spaces remain compliant, clean, and adhere to the Departments norms and standards. The Department of Health must ensure that facilities are provided with the adequate resources to secure timeous infrastructural repairs. We cannot allow are public facilities to disintegrate without proper interventions.
