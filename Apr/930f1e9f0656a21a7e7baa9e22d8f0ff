The DA has published a ‘Notice of Intention to Introduce and Invitation for Comment’ on our Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Amendment Act also known as the ‘Social Impact Bill’ in the Government Gazette. This Bill aims to remove the BBBEE consideration from the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA), and instead give priority to a tenderer’s competency, and under certain circumstances give preference to companies who have make a positive social impact through their contributions to a variety of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s). South African’s have grown tired of the rich and politically connected abusing the PPPFA to enrich themselves. This has made a mockery of what the Act sought to initially do – address the root causes of inequality of opportunity across South African society. This SDG model will have several benefits over the current BBBEE model: The DA encourages the public to submit their comments and views on our proposed Social Impact Bill as legislation@da.org.za. These will then be evaluated, and subsequently our Bill will be submitted to Parliament. The Social Impact Bill has the potential to transform South African for the better, by directly addressing the root causes of inequality of opportunity in our society.  By focusing on these causes, the PPPFA will be better positioned to create a better future for all South Africans.
