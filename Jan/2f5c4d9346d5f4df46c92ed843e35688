Please find attached soundbite by Baxolile ‘Bax’ Nodada MP. The DA commends the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) matric class of 2021 for their outstanding results, having a pass rate of 98.39%. These matrics faced exceptionally hard challenges to complete their studies and their outstanding results speak of their motivation, determination and perseverance. They had to complete both their senior years under a strenuous lockdown with constant changes to school regulations that lead to frequent interruptions to schooling. Despite the challenges of the rotational timetable, school closures and the need to work from home, these IEB learners did extremely well, with 89.2% achieving entry to degree study at a tertiary level. A further 7.82% qualified for admission to diploma study, and 1.37% achieved admission for study at the higher certificate level. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) must learn from the IEB and implement necessary changes to the schooling system so that we can see similar results for the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations. The DBE should: South Africa’s learners deserve to have bright futures. Increasing the quality of teaching and improving curriculum relevance not only ensure that learners are well-prepared for their matric examinations, but also their futures. Without these crucial interventions, South Africa’s economic decline will continue its rapid deterioration to the detriment of us all.
