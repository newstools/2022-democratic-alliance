The DA will lodge a formal complaint with the Parliamentary Ethics Committee regarding the failure of Pravin Gordhan, the Minister of Public Enterprises, and Enoch Godongwana, the Minister of Finance, to provide SAA information requested by the members of SCOPA during the SCOPA meeting on the 10th of May 2022 The SCOPA meeting regarding the transfer of 51% of the shares in SAA to the Takatso consortium was characterized by both Godongwana and Gordhan being evasive, defensive and cagey about the SAA/Takatso deal. The refusal to provide details of the agreement is far from transparent and is of major concern for the ability of Parliament to fulfill its oversight duties over State Owned Entities. This refusal to provide information on the basis that it is commercially sensitive just does not fly. How any competitor can be advantaged from knowing the losses that SAA is running at is a mystery. In all probability the SAA competitors probably know in real time what the SAA operating losses that are reputed to be hundreds of millions every month, are. Enoch Godongwana had initially been open with SCOPA by providing a detailed report on the concerns that National Treasury have with certain of the terms and conditions contained in the SAA/Takatso agreement signed on the 22 February 2022. At the eleventh hour the presentation was withdrawn on the basis that it was an “internal” document but was not replaced with any other presentation. The concerns detailed Godongwana were: There was also no clarity about the process that will have to be followed in order to deal with the SAA act, Act 5 of 2007. This Act was the vehicle under which SAA was created as an SOE and must be amended in order to enable the Takatso takeover of 51% of the shares in SAA.
