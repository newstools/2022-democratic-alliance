The Democratic Alliance yesterday handed documents to the HAWKS containing protected disclosures by whistle-blowers alleging fraud and/or corruption relating to subsistence, travel and entertainment allowance claims by the Speaker of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, Masizole Mnqasela. The whistle-blowers recently approached the leader of the DA Provincial Caucus, Alan Winde, to report these allegations. Mr Winde requested them to make formal submissions, backed by supporting evidence. On Wednesday this week, the whistle-blowers duly submitted protected disclosures, with documentary evidence. They wish to remain anonymous, a request we respect. As required by the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, the DA has reported the matter to the Hawks for investigation, including the documentary evidence provided in the protected disclosures. The DA has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption, and when evidence-based allegations arise, we hold our office bearers to account, without fear or favour. We are proud of our record of clean government and are deeply concerned about these developments. Apart from escalating the matter to the HAWKS, the DA has also reported the matter to its Federal Legal Commission (FLC) for urgent investigation. The Party will follow its internal disciplinary processes with deliberate speed to ensure accountability, while respecting Mr Mnqasela’s right to submit his defence in this matter.
